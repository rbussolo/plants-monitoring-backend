## Plants Monitoring - Backend

Created a backend resposability to store and provider data about the plants!

### How to works

In the path of project you have to install dependencies

`$ go get ./...`

To be honest I do not use this command.... so if do not works, tell me.

### Starting the server

To start the server (It is gonna run at port 9090).

<pre>
	cd .\src\
	go run .\main.go
</pre>
